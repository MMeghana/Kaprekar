# Kaprekar

It is a number(45) whose square(2025), when divided into 2 parts(20,25) and such that sum of parts
(20+25) is equal to given number. And none of the parts has value 0.

Ex1: input 
n = 45

(45 pow 2) = 2025 -> 202+5 , 20+25, 2+025

20 + 25 = 45

output: 45 is Kaprekar Number.


Ex2: n=13

13 pow 2 = 169
16+ 9 = 25
1+69 = 70

output: 13 is not kaprekar number

Ex3: n= 10

10 pow 2 = 100
10 + 0 = 10

Output: 10 is not kaprekar number
because one of the part is 0.
